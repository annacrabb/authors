    <p>Here is what I like about this author</p>
    <p>When Sir Terry Pratchett was knighted in 2009, he wanted to provide his own sword in order to be a proper knight. He personally excavated ore from local iron deposits, added several pieces of meteorite, and smelt them together into iron bars that a local blacksmith forged into a sword.</p>
    <p>In a 1995 interview with Bill Gates, Pratchett expressed concern that the internet could likely become a breeding ground for misinformation and conspiracy theories.</p>
    <p>Here is where I suggest you start with this author</p>
    <p>Guards! Guards!</p>
    <p>Mort</p>
    <p>Going Postal</p>
  </div>
