      <em>Known by many as the father of modern fantasy, J.R.R. Tolkien's legacy lives on in the many film adaptations of his stories that take place in Middle Earth. His world is given an unparalleled depth by the encyclopedic history he created, not only of how peoples and races interacted and evolved, but also how their languages interacted and evolved. Tolkien drew upon rich themes in Germanic and Celtic mythology, and created them anew for generations to come.</em>

      <h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
      <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> Tolkien invented the Elvish languages of Quenya and Sindarin first, before creating Middle Earth or the characters in his stories - not the other way around. He was a linguist and philologist first, and an author second.</h6>
      <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> The Hobbit was published in 1937, and quickly began to be translated into many different languages. The Nazi party was in power at the time, and a Berlin-based publishing house reached out to Tolkien for proof that he was not Jewish in order to publish his book in Germany. Tolkien responded through his own publisher with the classiest clapback:</h6>
      <blockquote>I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject â€” which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.</blockquote>
      <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> Tolkien fought in World War I as an officer. His first and only battle was the Battle of the Somme, which was the deadliest battle in WWI, and marks the first time tanks were used in combat. Tolkien contracted trench fever, a lice-born illness, and did not recover enough to rejoin the fight.</h6>

      <h5>Where to start with J.R.R. Tolkien:</h5>
      <p><i>The Hobbit</i></p>
      <p>Though published as a children's novel, The Hobbit is a classic adventure for all ages and an excellent first forray into Middle Earth. It explores themes of greed, trust, heroism, and birthright, and presents the reader with real stakes and true loss.</p>
      <p><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></p>
      <p>What became an installment of three novels with two disctint books in each, was originally supposed to be a simple sequel to the very succesful predecessor. The Lord of the Rings was published in parts, starting with The Fellowship of the Ring, due to the rationing that took place during World War II. Though sometimes plagued with meandering prose, The Lord of the Rings is a beautiful story of power, forgiveness, war, death, and true friendship.</p>
