      <h4 className="center">Isaac Asimov</h4>
      <em>Asimov is most widely known for two of his longer series - the Robot Mysteries, and the Foundation series - though he also wrote many stand-alone books, collections of short stories, and speculative nonfiction. He is lauded as one of the fathers of modern Science Fiction, but he was also a keen mystery author.</em>

      <h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
      
        <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> Asimov was asked by his agents to write a children's series that would be adapted into a television series. He was afraid the adaptation wouldn't turn out well, so he decided to use a pseudonym - Paul French. Even though the series fell through, he continued to write Lucky Starr installations as Paul French.</h6>
        <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> Asimov coined the term 'robotics,' first written in 1941, to describe the scientific study of robots. Interestingly, the word 'robot' was coined just a couple decades prior, from the Russian word for 'work' or 'worker.'</h6>

      <h5>Where to start with Isaac Asimov:</h5>
      <h6>Buy Jupiter and Other Stories</h6>
      <em>This is an incredible compilation of science fiction short stories, and the titular story is still the one I recommend people read first.</em>
      <h6>I, Robot</h6>
      <em>This fixup collection of short stories chronicles the invention of robots as they exist in Asimov's stories, and how two scientists came up with the Three Laws of Robotics through trial and error.</em>
      <h6>Caves of Steel</h6>
      <em>Though the film I, Robot took it's name from the above collection, the plot is loosely based on the first of Asimov's Robot Series. It centers around an impossibly realistic robot named R. Daneel Olivaw and a human detective named Elijah Baley. If you're not a fan of short stories, there's no better place to start. Asimov's mysteries are clever, riveting, and insightful.</em>
