      <h4 className="center">Philip K. Dick</h4>
      <em>Philip K. Dick was an American author who became known for paranoid science fiction that explored themes of the nature of reality, perception, identity, and drug abuse. Many of his novels and short stories became the basis for movie and television show adaptations, including Blade Runner, Total Recall, and The Man in the High Castle.</em>

      <h5>Fun Facts:</h5>
      <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> While the film <em>Blade Runner</em> was only loosely based on the novel <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em>, the the movie makers frequently sought PKD's input as the movie was produced. PKD's opinion turned from highly critical to the screenplay to largely favorable of what he saw of the final product. He was able to see a small clip of the special effects before the movie was released, but sadly passed away just a few months before release.</h6>
      <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> PKD was plagued with drug use throughout his life. Being a young child in the early 1930's diagnosed with asthma, he was prescribed methamphetamines as a treatment, and it all kinda went downhill from there. Many of his works feature reality-altering drug abuse. He wrote A Scanner Darkly after getting sober, which is about a futuristic, drug-addled Orange County, California, and dedicated it to all the people he'd lost due to drug overdoses.</h6>
      <h6><i className="material-icons">favorite_border</i> Many film adaptations of PKD's works are only loosely based on the source material, and often changed the title. For example, <i>Total Recall</i> is based on a short story called <i>We Can Remember it For Your Wholesale</i>. Other well-known movies carry the same name, but you may not know they're actually based on a short story or novel! Minority Report, Paycheck, and The Man in the High Castle are all adaptations of PKD's works.</h6>

      <h5>Where to start with PKD:</h5>
      <h6 class="title">UBIK</h6>
      <p>One of PKD's most iconic works, UBIK begins with an explosion aboard a spaceship that almost kills everyone on board. All but one of them walk away - but then time stops behaving and mysterious deaths follow. UBIK explores themes of the nature of reality and perception, and life and death. Caution: if you've never doubted your own experience of reality, you're about to.</p>
      <h6 class="title">A Scanner Darkly</h6>
      <p>Likely the source material for one of the truest film adaptations, A Scanner Darkly is a semi-autobiographical story that portrays a dystopian, drug-addled California. When an undercover policeman is assigned to investigate his own household and starts taking a dangerous drug that leads to breaks in personalities, the protagonist becomes a victim of one of these breaks. He is at once the hunted and the hunter - the watcher and the watched. None of PKD's stories are particularly light, but this is one of the darkest.</p>
      <h6 class="title">The Philip K. Dick Reader</h6>
      <p>Though there are many different compilations of PKD's short stories, this is the best one I've found that truly contains his 'greatest hits.' Included are the two short stories that were adapted into Minority Report (the short story bears the same name) and Total Recall (the short story is called We Can Remember it For You Wholesale). It also includes a few stories that were more recently adapted into Electric Dreams by Amazon TV.</p>

      <em>PKD survived an incredibly complex and traumatic childhood that undoubtedly informed many of the themes throughout his works. Many biographies have been written, but this one is currently my favorite. Clinical psychologist Kyle Arnold shows readers how </em> */}
